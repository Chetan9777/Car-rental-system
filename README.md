# Car-rental-system
This project is designed to be used by a Car Rental Company specializing in renting 
cars to customers.
It is an online system through which customers can view available cars, register, view 
profile and book a car. Car rental agencies primarily serve people who require a 
temporary vehicle, those who do not own their car, travelers who are out of town, 
or owners of damaged or destroyed vehicles who are awaiting repair or insurance 
compensation.
